game_board.rb defines the GameBoard class which represents the game board. It has three instance methods:

initialize initializes a new instance of GameBoard with a DEFAULT_BOARD constant, which is a string representation of the board's initial layout.
display prints the current state of the board.
place_mark(selection, mark) replaces the selection position in the game board with the mark character.
game.rb defines the Game class which represents the game itself. It has ten instance methods:

initialize initializes a new instance of Game. It does the following:
Clears the screen and displays the logo.
Initializes two new Player instances.
Calls Player.reset_marks.
Sets game_won to false.
Initializes a new GameBoard instance.
Calls the play method.
logo prints the game logo.
clear_screen clears the console and prints the logo.
get_player_name(player_number) prompts the user to input a valid name for the player_number (1 or 2).
make_player_move(player) prompts player to make a move, places the move on the game board, clears the console and prints the updated game board. Then checks if the game is over.
play displays the initial game board and starts a loop that alternates between player1 and player2 making moves until the game is over.
game_over?(total_moves) checks if the game is over. If the game is won by player1 or player2, displays the winner and calls the play_again? method. If the game is a tie, displays a tie message and calls the play_again? method. Returns true if the game is over, false otherwise.
play_again? prompts the user to play again. If the user answers "yes" or "y", initializes a new Game. Otherwise, exits the program.
winner?(player) checks if player has won the game by comparing player's selected positions to a hash of winning conditions. If player has won, sets the winner instance variable to player, sets game_won to true, and returns true. Otherwise, returns false.
tie?(total_moves) checks if the game is a tie by comparing total_moves to 8 (the maximum number of moves in a game) and checking if the game has been won. Returns true if the game is a tie, false otherwise.
player.rb defines the Player class which represents a player in the game. It has three instance variables:

@name stores the player's name.
@player_mark stores the player's game piece (either "◯" or "✕").
@selections stores an array of the player's selected positions on the game board.
It has four class variables:

@@marks stores the available game pieces.
@@taken stores an array of already taken game pieces.
It has two class methods:

reset_marks empties @@taken and refills @@marks with game pieces.
taken?(mark) checks if mark is already taken and returns true or false.
It has one instance method:

make_move(player) prompts player to select a position on the game board. If the position is valid (not already taken and within 1-9), returns the position. Otherwise, prompts the user to
